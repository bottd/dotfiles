# Refactoring Summary and Changes

## Issues Identified

1. **Path Resolution Problems**
   - The repository was in transition between old and new directory structures
   - Inconsistent approaches to path resolution across configurations
   - Mixture of relative paths and path object usage

2. **Duplication of Configuration**
   - Multiple occurrences of the same settings across different files
   - Locale settings, network manager, and allowUnfree duplicated
   - Both old (nixOS/) and new (system/) structures active simultaneously

3. **Home-Manager Configuration**
   - Home-manager configuration in flake.nix using direct paths instead of path object
   - Inconsistent path references between system and home configurations

4. **Incomplete Hyprland Integration**
   - Hyprland configuration defined in old structure but not migrated to new structure

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed Path Resolution**
   - Updated flake.nix to use consistent path objects for home-manager configuration
   - Ensured all paths are properly referenced using the paths object
   - Removed direct references to home modules with relative paths

2. **Reduced Duplication**
   - Removed duplicate NetworkManager configuration from system/hosts/desktop/configuration.nix
   - Kept shared settings in appropriate modules (base, common/linux)
   - Improved organization of configuration settings

3. **Added Hyprland Support**
   - Created system/modules/hyprland/default.nix module
   - Updated system/hosts/desktop/default.nix to include Hyprland module
   - Ensured consistent configuration across system and home modules

4. **Created Migration Plan**
   - Developed comprehensive plan for migrating to flake-parts
   - Documented approach in FLAKE_PARTS_MIGRATION.md
   - Provided sample structure and implementation steps

## Current Status

The refactoring is now in a much better state with:

1. **Consistent Path Handling**
   - All configurations now use the paths object for referencing locations
   - No more broken relative path references that could fail in the Nix store
   - Fixed flake.nix to properly handle path variables in home-manager config

2. **Modular Structure**
   - Clear separation between system and home configuration
   - Platform-specific modules properly organized
   - Host-specific settings isolated from shared configurations

3. **Reduced Duplication**
   - Common settings consolidated in shared modules
   - More maintainable configuration with less redundancy

4. **Improved Extensibility**
   - Easier to add new hosts with the modular structure
   - Better organization for future additions

5. **Verified Working Configuration**
   - Successfully passes `nix flake check`
   - Ready for further refinements

## Current Progress with flake-parts

1. **Initial flake-parts Integration**
   - ✅ Added flake-parts to inputs
   - ✅ Converted flake.nix to use flake-parts.lib.mkFlake
   - ✅ Moved formatter and devShells to perSystem attribute
   - ✅ Configured system configurations in flake attribute
   - ✅ Successfully passing flake checks

2. **Enhanced flake-parts Structure**
   - ✅ Organized flake.nix into logical sections with comments
   - ✅ Created consistent paths object for all configurations
   - ✅ Simplified specialArgs handling with inherit statements
   - ✅ Added documentation for the new structure

3. **Implemented Helper Functions**
   - ✅ Created `mkNixosSystem` helper function for standardized NixOS configurations
   - ✅ Created `mkDarwinSystem` helper function for standardized Darwin configurations
   - ✅ Created `mkHomeConfig` helper function for standardized home-manager configurations
   - ✅ Simplified system configuration definitions using these helpers
   - ✅ Used a consistent pattern for all configurations

## Future Recommendations

1. ✅ **Helper Functions for Configuration**
   - ✅ Created standardized functions for system configuration
   - ✅ Simplified flake.nix with reusable patterns
   - ✅ Reduced duplication and improved consistency

2. ✅ **Documentation**
   - ✅ Updated README.md with the new helper functions
   - ✅ Created lib/README.md to document deprecated code
   - ✅ Updated REFACTOR.md and NEXT_STEPS.md with progress

3. **Remove Legacy Code**
   - Remove deprecated lib directory after confirming stability
   - Clean up any remaining duplicate code paths
   - Standardize on the new helper function approach

4. **Consolidate Home Manager Modules**
   - Consider moving home modules from top-level `home/` directory to `system/modules/home`
   - Ensure paths are updated in flake.nix helper functions
   - Requires git commit after moving to ensure Nix store references are correct

5. **Add Testing and CI Integration**
   - Set up automated testing for configurations
   - Implement CI pipeline for validating changes
   - Create deployment strategy for different hosts

The refactoring has successfully addressed the immediate issues with path resolution and module organization. The implementation of helper functions has significantly improved the maintainability of the configuration by providing consistent patterns and reducing duplication. The configuration is now much cleaner, more modular, and easier to extend with new hosts or features.
