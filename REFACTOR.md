# Refactoring Status and Recommendations

## Current Status

1. ✅ **Flake-parts Integration**
   - ✅ Basic flake-parts structure implemented
   - ✅ Working flake check with minimal modifications
   - ✅ Dev shell added with flake check passing

2. ✅ **New Directory Structure**
   - ✅ Created `system/modules` with common settings
   - ✅ Created `system/hosts` for host-specific configs
   - ✅ Organized home-manager modules by platform
   - ✅ Created cross-platform module structure with platform detection
   - ✅ Successfully migrated to use the new directory structure

3. ✅ **Path Resolution Challenges**
   - ✅ Resolved path issues using direct paths and proper module structure
   - ✅ Implemented a working approach for stable path resolution
   - ✅ Successfully built configurations using the new structure

## Path Resolution Solution

When Nix evaluates files in the store, paths are processed differently than when working with local files:

1. **Main Issue**: Paths like `../../system/modules` don't resolve correctly in the Nix store
2. **Root Cause**: Files are copied to store locations like `/nix/store/hash-name/` where relative paths don't match

Solutions attempted and results:

1. **String interpolation with self.outPath**: Worked inconsistently
   ```nix
   "${inputs.self.outPath}/path/to/file"
   ```

2. **Using builtins.path for references**: Worked best for some scenarios
   ```nix
   builtins.path {
     path = ../../path/to/file;
     name = "file-name";
   }
   ```

3. **Exposing modules through flake outputs**: Good for clean interfaces
   ```nix
   # In flake.nix
   nixosModules.myModule = ./path/to/module;

   # In configuration
   imports = [ inputs.self.nixosModules.myModule ];
   ```

4. **Passing through paths object**: Most stable approach
   ```nix
   # In flake.nix
   specialArgs.paths = {
     systemModules = ./system/modules;
     homeModules = ./home/modules;
   };

   # In configuration
   imports = [ paths.systemModules ];
   ```

After testing all approaches, we found the most stable solution was using a paths object passed through specialArgs, combined with more direct imports.

## Migration Completed

The repository now uses the new structure exclusively:

1. **System Configurations**:
   - `./system/modules/` - Common system modules (base, users, platform-specific)
   - `./system/hosts/` - Host-specific configurations (desktop, pocket, macbook)

2. **Home Manager Configurations**:
   - `./home/common/` - Common home-manager modules
   - `./home/linux/` - Linux-specific home-manager modules
   - `./home/darwin/` - macOS-specific home-manager modules
   - `./home/hosts/` - Host-specific home-manager configurations (iris)

The staged migration approach was successful:

1. ✅ Stage 1: Direct module content with proper path handling using specialArgs.paths
2. ✅ Stage 2: Clean module structure with platform-specific detection
3. ✅ Stage 3: Full flake check passing with the new structure

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Migration Complete**:
   - ✅ Successfully migrated all hosts to new structure
   - ✅ Created correct path handling solution
   - ✅ All configurations build and pass flake checks

2. ✅ **Integrated treefmt**:
   - ✅ Installed and configured treefmt for formatting
   - ✅ Set up treefmt with formatters for Nix and other languages
   - ✅ Added formatter to the dev shell

3. ✅ **Added Helper Functions**:
   - ✅ Created `mkNixosSystem` helper function for NixOS configurations
   - ✅ Created `mkDarwinSystem` helper function for Darwin configurations
   - ✅ Created `mkHomeConfig` helper function for home-manager configurations
   - ✅ Used helper functions to simplify system configurations
   - ✅ Standardized paths handling across all configurations

4. ✅ **Fixed Bootloader Configuration**:
   - ✅ Fixed bootloader configuration for NixOS systems
   - ✅ Added explicit grub devices configuration to resolve build issues
   - ✅ Successfully ran flake check on all configurations

5. **Potential Improvements**:
   - Consider consolidating duplicated settings
   - Further modularize common functionality
   - Add more hosts as needed using the new structure as a template

## Conclusion

The refactoring has been successfully completed. The new directory structure provides a more modular, maintainable configuration that separates concerns clearly between system modules, host-specific settings, and home-manager configurations. The path resolution issues have been solved using a consistent approach with specialArgs.paths, and all configurations now build successfully with the new structure.

Key improvements include:

1. **Modular Structure**:
   - Clear separation between system modules, host-specific settings, and home-manager configurations
   - Platform-specific modules that automatically apply the right settings based on the host

2. **Path Handling**:
   - Consistent approach using the paths object to reference files
   - No more path resolution issues when evaluating in the Nix store
   - All imports use the same pattern for predictable behavior

3. **Helper Functions**:
   - Standard functions for creating NixOS, Darwin, and home-manager configurations
   - Reduced duplication and improved consistency in configuration settings
   - Simpler flake.nix with clear sections for different types of configurations

4. **flake-parts Integration**:
   - Better organization of flake outputs with logical sections
   - Improved development experience with formatter integration
   - More maintainable structure for future extensions

This modular design makes it easier to:
1. Add new hosts by creating a new directory in system/hosts or home/hosts
2. Share common configuration across systems
3. Apply platform-specific settings automatically
4. Maintain a clean separation between system and user configurations

The migration is complete, and the flake is now using the new structure exclusively with helper functions to improve maintainability.
